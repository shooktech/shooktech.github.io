			We are a group of innovative young professionals who  
			unwittingly established the Detroit Packing Co. while studying at MSU back in 2012 when we were selling Linksys routers out of our dorm. After graduation-no, we didn't drop out like the cool kids-we decided that we wanted to change the world. So we moved to the only logical place to do that, the best place to change the world economically and socially from. We moved to The Bay. The DPC isn't just some startup full of craft beer drinking, slacklining millennials with nothing palpable to contribute. We actually do, and mean, business!

			Our website currently doesn't offer e-commerce but will soon! We are building the store as we speak, line by line of code. In the meantime you can securely  shop with us through our
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main?ie=UTF8&asin=&seller=A13ZDU6VPG0TGQ" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://squareup.com/market/detroit-packing-co" target="_blank">Square</a> 
			storefronts. Make sure to leave feedback, whether it be good or bad; we want to 
			learn from you.

			Because we don't have time for people who need jobs, we're looking for people who <span class="emphasis">want</span> them!
			 If this sounds like you then you might make a good
