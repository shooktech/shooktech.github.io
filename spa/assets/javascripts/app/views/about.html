			<p class="statement">
			We had a hobby of selling things online, using our dorm at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University">MSU</a> 
			as a warehouse. It was a small operation. Linksys routers and the occasional burner. selling on Amazon was so novel to us that we 
			thought it was the coolest thing even though we hardly made money. But our operation matured. 
			We had moved from the dorms tp a house. We were shipping a dozen 50 pound boxes twice a week. 
			The house had a security camera. The UPS employees passive-aggresively coerced us into helping load and unload our boxes. We 
			evaded them by going out for pizza when they came. It was undeniable. We had a small business.

			<br>

			After graduation, yes we finished unlike the cool kids, we decided that the status quo wasn't enough. We didn't want to just get "jobs" 
			or own "businesses" We wanted to be make an impact! 
			We wanted to save the world. We wanted to be super heroes. So we moved to the only logical place to do that. We moved to The Bay, where people obviate economic and social inequality 
			from the most unaffordable metropolis in the world!

			The DPC isn't just some startup full of craft beer drinking, slacklining millennials with nothing palpable to contribute. We actually do and mean business! 
			We are an innovative creative group of Michiganders who are spreading the Detroit quality one package at a time.
